# Optimization Features

## Developer-Suggested Superinstructions

GameVM allows developers to suggest methods as candidates for superinstruction creation, similar to function inlining hints in modern languages.

### Example
```csharp
// Developer suggests this method as a superinstruction candidate
calculate_sum(x, y) {
    result = x + y
    store_value(result)
}
```

The compiler considers these suggestions alongside other criteria:
- Method complexity and size
- Number of parameters and locals
- Usage frequency in the codebase
- Potential performance impact
- Available instruction space

## Automatic Superinstruction Detection

GameVM automatically identifies and optimizes frequently occurring instruction sequences:

### Analysis Features
- Pattern Analysis: Analyzes bytecode to identify common sequences
- Frequency Threshold: Creates superinstructions for frequent patterns
- Cost-Benefit Analysis: Evaluates trade-offs between code size and speed
- Cross-Module Analysis: Detects patterns across different source files

### Configuration
```json
{
    "superinstructions": {
        "minFrequency": 10,        // Minimum occurrences needed
        "maxLength": 4,            // Maximum instructions per sequence
        "maxSuperInstructions": 32 // Maximum number to generate
    }
}
```

## JIT Compilation

GameVM includes optional JIT compilation capabilities for platforms with sufficient resources, primarily targeting 5th generation consoles.
