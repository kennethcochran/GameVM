# High-Level Intermediate Representation (HLIR)

## Overview
The High-Level Intermediate Representation (HLIR) serves as the first stage in the compilation process. It is designed to be language-independent, allowing for a variety of high-level languages to be represented in a unified format. The HLIR maintains the structure and semantics of the original source code while abstracting away language-specific details.

## Data Structure
The HLIR consists of the following components:

- **Function Definitions:**
  - Name
  - Parameters (with types)
  - Return type
  - Body (a list of statements)

- **Control Structures:**
  - Conditionals (if, switch)
  - Loops (for, while)

- **Variable Declarations:**
  - Variable name
  - Type
  - Scope information

- **Expressions:**
  - Arithmetic and logical operations
  - Function calls
  - Access to variables and constants

- **Type Information:**
  - Type annotations for variables and return types

## Data Structure Type
The HLIR will utilize a **tree structure** to represent the hierarchical nature of the code, allowing for easy traversal and manipulation during optimization phases. Each node in the tree corresponds to a construct in the source code, facilitating semantic analysis and transformations.

## Purpose
The HLIR allows for early-stage optimizations and serves as a foundation for further transformations into lower-level representations. It retains enough structure for potential debugging and analysis while being flexible enough to accommodate various source languages.
