# Mid-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR)

## Overview
The Mid-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) acts as a bridge between the high-level constructs of the HLIR and the low-level details of the LLIR. It focuses on resource management and optimization opportunities, making it crucial for performance tuning and analysis.

## Data Structure Type
The MLIR will utilize a **graph structure** to represent control flow and data dependencies. This allows for more complex optimizations, such as dead code elimination and constant propagation, by enabling analysis of relationships between different code blocks and instructions.

## Data Structure
The MLIR includes the following components:

- **Function Signatures:**
  - Name
  - Parameter types
  - Return type

- **Basic Blocks:**
  - A list of instructions that form a single entry point and exit point
  - Control flow information (jumps, branches)

- **Resource Analysis:**
  - Memory usage estimates (ROM, RAM)
  - Stack usage tracking
  - Bank switching analysis

- **Optimizations:**
  - Dead code elimination
  - Constant propagation
  - Common subexpression elimination

## Purpose
The MLIR is designed to facilitate optimizations and analyses that are independent of specific hardware architectures. It prepares the code for further lowering to machine-specific representations while ensuring that resource constraints are respected and managed effectively.
