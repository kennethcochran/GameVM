# Low-Level Intermediate Representation (LLIR)

## Overview
The Low-Level Intermediate Representation (LLIR) is the final stage before generating machine code. It is closely tied to the target architecture, allowing for specific optimizations and mappings to the underlying hardware.

## Data Structure
The LLIR consists of the following components:

- **Instructions:**
  - Machine-level instructions or their equivalents
  - Opcode representation
  - Operand information (registers, immediate values, memory addresses)

- **Control Flow Constructs:**
  - Branching instructions (jumps, calls)
  - Labeling for entry and exit points of blocks

- **Register Allocation:**
  - Mapping of variables to registers
  - Stack frame information

- **Platform-Specific Features:**
  - Handling of bank switching
  - Specific calling conventions

## Data Structure Type
The LLIR will use a **linear list or array structure** to represent instructions, allowing for efficient traversal and direct mapping to machine code. This structure is optimal for the final stages of code generation, where instruction ordering and memory layout are critical for performance.

## Purpose
The LLIR serves as the last abstraction layer before generating the final machine code. It ensures that the code is optimized for the target architecture while maintaining the necessary semantics from the higher-level representations. This representation is crucial for achieving the performance characteristics required by retro gaming hardware.
