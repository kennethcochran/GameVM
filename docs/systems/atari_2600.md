## GameVM Implementation Notes
### Compiler Considerations
- Preferred Code Generation Strategy: Pure native code
- Register Allocation Strategy:
  - Heavy use of zero page
  - Minimize stack usage
  - Keep critical variables in registers
- Memory Management Strategy:
  - Static allocation only
  - Careful stack management
  - Bank switching for large programs
- Optimization Opportunities:
  - Cycle-exact code generation
  - Zero page optimization critical
  - Kernel-style video generation

### Performance Targets
- Minimum Frame Rate: 60 FPS (NTSC), 50 FPS (PAL)
- Audio Update Frequency: As needed
- Memory Budget:
  - RAM: 128 bytes total
  - Zero Page/Stack: 128 bytes shared
  - ROM: 2KB minimum, up to 64KB with banking
- Known Limitations:
  - No video buffer
  - Extremely limited RAM
  - Real-time video generation required

### Special Handling
- Bank Switching Implementation:
  - Must track current bank
  - Bank switch only during VBLANK
  - Consider ROM layout carefully
- Interrupt Management:
  - No hardware interrupts
  - All timing done through cycle counting
- Audio Mixing Strategy:
  - Direct TIA register updates
  - Volume mixing in software if needed
- Graphics Pipeline:
  - Scanline-based rendering
  - Cycle-exact sprite positioning
  - Color changes must be cycle-timed
