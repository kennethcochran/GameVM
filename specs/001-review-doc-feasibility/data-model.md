# Data Model: Documentation Review Report

This document defines the structure for the final report generated by the documentation review process. The report should be a single markdown file.

## 1. Report Header

-   **Title**: Documentation Consistency and Feasibility Report
-   **Date**: The date the report was finalized.
-   **Author**: The name of the reviewer.
-   **Version**: 1.0

## 2. Executive Summary

A brief, high-level summary of the findings. This section should highlight the most critical inconsistencies and the most significant feasibility concerns.

## 3. Inconsistency Catalog

A detailed list of all identified inconsistencies. Each entry in the catalog should follow this structure:

-   **Inconsistency ID**: A unique identifier (e.g., INC-001).
-   **Description**: A clear and concise description of the inconsistency.
-   **Conflicting Sources**: A list of 2 or more sources that are in conflict. Each source should include:
    -   **File Path**: The path to the markdown file.
    -   **Line Numbers (Optional)**: The relevant line numbers, if applicable.
    -   **Quote**: The specific text that is in conflict.
-   **Recommended Resolution**: A suggestion on how to resolve the inconsistency.

## 4. Feature Categorization

A table categorizing the major features found in the documentation.

| Feature Name | Status | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Feature Name] | Implemented / Feasible / Aspirational | [Brief explanation for the categorization] |

## 5. Feasibility Analysis

This section provides a detailed analysis for every feature categorized as "Aspirational". Each analysis should include:

-   **Feature Name**: The name of the aspirational feature.
-   **Summary**: A description of what the feature does, as per the documentation.
-   **Feasibility Verdict**: A final verdict: "Feasible", "Feasible with Constraints", or "Not Feasible".
-   **Detailed Analysis**: A breakdown of the feature's requirements against the technical capabilities of the target console profiles (L1-L7). This should be based on the "Detailed API/Hardware Analysis" criteria, referencing specific hardware limitations (memory, CPU, APIs) from `docs/platforms/CapabilityProfiles.md`.
-   **Risks and Mitigations**: Any risks associated with attempting to implement the feature and potential ways to mitigate them.
